With Sampling you can decide to generate sample images. 
Define the frequency, then add samples with a seed and a prompt. For embedding training, the prompt needs `<embedding>` as a placeholder.
The generated images will be saved in the Workspace directory. Note you can change and add samples during training.

With Backup, you can save intermediate versions of your model.
Define a frequency. The intermediate versions of your model will be saved in the Workspace directory.
